# Ray Marching Tool

A **3D modeling application** written in **C++** and **OpenGL**, leveraging **Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)** to create, blend, and manipulate primitive shapes. This project provides an interactive environment where shapes can be added or removed, and blended using union, subtraction, and intersectionâ€”each with a customizable smooth factor. You can also change colors and lighting parameters on the fly.

> **Note**: This is an early-stage project. Proper HDRi support, an improved raster-based renderer, and a path tracing renderer are in progress. Future plans include additional blend modes, multiple lights, more parameters, and a wider range of primitive shapes.

## Features

- **SDF Modeling**  
  - Add or remove primitive shapes (currently spheres, with more on the way).
  - Apply blending operations: **Union**, **Subtract**, **Intersect**.
  - Control blending smoothness per shape.

- **Shape Hierarchy**  
  - Blend modes depend on their position in the shape directory hierarchy.

- **Color & Lighting Controls**  
  - Change the color of shapes individually.
  - Adjust the light color, position, and intensity.

- **Interactive Interface**  
  - Real-time feedback using an ImGui-based GUI.
  - Transform shapes (translate, rotate, scale) via a user-friendly interface.

- **Rendering**  
  - OpenGL raster-based rendering (improvements in progress).
  - **HDRi support** (in progress).
  - **Path tracing renderer** (in progress).
